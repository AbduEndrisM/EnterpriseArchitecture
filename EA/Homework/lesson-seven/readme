ORM Optimization
This project is done to compare the various ORM N+1 problem solving methods

I used Entity graph, FetchJoin, BatchSize and Fetc.SUBSELECT methods.

Note: Different outputs are discovered for multiple excution of the same method!


Experiment I- input: List of 100,000 pets (Owner has Pets - 1:N)

EntityGraph:
To fetch this data from the database took 109 milliseconds.

FetchJoin
To fetch this data from the database took 108 milliseconds.


SizeBatch (size =50)
To fetch this data from the database took 119 milliseconds.

Fetch.SUBSELECT
To fetch this data from the database took 103 milliseconds.
